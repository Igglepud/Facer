      This page explains the privacy policy for the app Phacer created by the developer <br>
      Igglepud for Google Play. <br>
      You are free to play Phacer without fear of any data collection. Phacer<br>
      neither collects nor shares user data of any kind.<br>
      <br>
      Just for emphasis, absolutely NO data is collected by the app Phacer created by <br>
      the developer Igglepud. No advertising is included in the app. There are no <br>
      in-app purchases. Beyond the 99 cents you spent on the app, there are no additional<br>
      costs or fees associated with the app Phacer created by the developer Igglepud for <br>
      Google Play.<br>
      <br>
      Here is a list of all the data collected by the app Phacer created by the developer <br>
      Igglepud for Google Play and all the ways that data is used and shared with third<br>
      parties:<br>
      <br>
           <list>NONE</list>   <-- LIST OF WAYS DATA IS USED<br>
<br>
      It's an empty list because the app Phacer created by the developer Igglepud for <br>
      Google Play does not collect, store, maintain, sell, share, or in any other way use <br>
      your personal data. <br>
<br>
      You may be wondering at this point, "what types of advertising will I or my children<br>
      be exposed to by using the app Phacer created by the developer Igglepud for <br>
      Google Play"? Below is a detailed list of every single possible type of advertising<br>
      that could appear in the app Phacer created by the developer Igglepud for <br>
      Google Play when you use it:<br>
      <br>
        <list>        NONE          </list>       <-- LIST OF ADVERTISING INCLUDED<br>
<br>
      That is also an empty list. No advertising is present at all. Your children will not<br>
      be exposed to inapproriate advertisements and neither will you because the app Phacer <br>
      created by the developer Igglepud for Google Play does not contain any advertising<br>
      whatsoever. <br>
